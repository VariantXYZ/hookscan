A simple DLL that provides a console interface for scanning and modifying memory of Windows applications. Made as an inferior alternative to Cheat Engine in cases where CE is blocked for whatever reason.

Load it up via AppInit_DLLs or a proxy. After loading, the DLL itself is straight forward enough.

Currently implemented functionality:
's' - Search
'm' - Monitor
'c' - Modify
